## Overview

This example demonstrates how to use Coala to perform query-driven gene variant analysis: retrieving gene metadata from NCBI, extracting variants from its ClinVar VCF files, filtering by clinical significance, and performing detailed variant annotation.

The details of this example are available at [Coala website](https://coala.info/use-cases/Gene-Variant.html).
